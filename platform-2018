If the calculation of delegate and alternate entitlements by Congressional District are different from the calculation of delegate and alternate entitlements by County or Senatorial District, the following guidelines shall be used in adjusting the total delegate/alternate entitlements:
<ol>
 	<li>The delegate and alternate totals shall not be greater than the delegate/alternate calculation for the County or Senatorial District except that any Congressional District shall be entitled to elect at least one (1) delegate and one (1) alternate which may cause the delegate/alternate entitlement for a County or Senatorial District to exceed the total entitlement for the County or Senatorial District by the number of delegates and alternates from one (1) or more Congressional Districts with less than enough votes to get an entitlement of greater than one (1) pursuant to Section a of this Rule, in a presidential election year;</li>
 	<li>Except as provided in Subsection 1 above, if the calculation for delegates and alternates by Congressional District should exceed the number of delegates and alternates by Senatorial District, then the delegate and alternate entitlement to the Congressional District shall be reduced beginning with the smallest fraction, then continuing to the next higher fraction until the calculations are equal;</li>
 	<li>If the calculation for delegates and alternates by Senatorial District should exceed the number of delegates and alternates by Congressional District, then the delegate and alternate entitlement to the Congressional District shall be increased beginning with the highest fraction, then continuing to the next lower fraction until the calculations are equal;</li>
 	<li>In a presidential election year, each delegate and each alternate shall have credentials for both the Senatorial District and the Congressional District Caucuses and if a delegate or alternate is not credentialed for both, the delegate or alternate shall not be credentialed for either.</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>In the event of boundary changes among precincts or districts, or the creation or deletion of precincts or districts since the most recent gubernatorial election, the following rules shall govern the allocation of gubernatorial votes to the changed or newly created precincts or districts.
<ol>
 	<li>The apportionment of gubernatorial votes to the newly created or changed precincts or districts shall be made using any fair and equitable method for making such determination.</li>
 	<li>The County Executive Committee shall apportion to each precinct the number of votes to be used in allocating the number of delegates and alternates which may be elected by such precincts using any fair and equitable method for making the determination.</li>
 	<li>When the boundaries of a Senatorial District or Congressional District have changed or a new district formed causing a boundary change in an election precinct, the apportionment of gubernatorial votes to each precinct shall be used in allocating the number of delegates to be elected in each affected district.</li>
 	<li>If the County Executive Committee fails to act before the first (1st) day of candidate filing for a place on the General Primary ballot for public office, the SREC shall make such apportionment of the gubernatorial vote to precincts.</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>The Permanent Convention Chair of the County Convention or Senatorial District Convention shall send Notice of Election to every Delegate and Alternate to the State Convention.

However, if no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast statewide in the Presidential Primary and only one candidate receives twenty percent (20%) or more of the statewide vote, then the remaining at-large delegates and alternates shall be apportioned between the candidate receiving more than twenty percent (20%) of the statewide vote and the candidate receiving the second highest number of votes, in the ratio which the number of votes received by each such candidate bears to the total votes for both such candidates, rounding fractional delegates and alternates upward to the next whole number beginning with the candidate receiving the largest number of votes.</li>
 	<li>No Candidate Receives Twenty Percent (20%) of Vote: If no candidate receives more than twenty percent (20%) of the votes cast statewide in the Presidential Primary, the remaining at-large delegates and alternates shall be apportioned among all candidates, beginning with the candidate receiving the highest number of votes and rounding fractional delegates and alternates upward to the next whole number, and then awarding delegates and alternates to the second highest candidate in the same manner, and so forth until the remaining at-large delegates and alternates to be apportioned have been fully awarded.</li>
