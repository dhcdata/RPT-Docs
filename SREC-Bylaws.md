 	<li>At the sole discretion of the Auxiliaries and Coalitions Committee, some or all of the required documents may be waived for existing auxiliaries that are current ex-officio members, if the committee determines they are in good standing according to a March questionnaire preceding the State Convention. The questionnaire must be notarized.</li>
 	<li>All correspondence pertaining to provisions in this paragraph shall be addressed to the Chairman, Auxiliaries and Coalitions Committee, at the State Headquarters.</li>
 	<li>Non-voting ex-officio status on the SREC may be granted to auxiliaries meeting the criteria established by the Auxiliaries and Coalitions Committee. For each term of the SREC, at the second quarterly meeting following the biennial State Convention, the Auxiliaries and Coalitions Committee shall recommend non-voting ex-officio status for organizations that the Committee decides meets all criteria set by the Committee, which status shall be granted only by majority vote of the SREC for its term.
